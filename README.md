# CST-120 Milestone Project
pages site

## This is the repository for my web site built for CST-120
This web site is a work in progress as I work through the CST-120 Course in Grand Canyon University.

This website is visible by going to venus-martinez.github.io/CST-Milestone/

Feel free to take a look around!

This will be further adjusted through this course to align with the specifications of the projects. After this course, this may be further worked on in later courses or I may just take it upon myself to work on it further in my spare time.
